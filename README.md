A Proctor Management System (PMS) is a system that manages information typically involving studentâ€™s personal information, marks, employee information, supervisor information and Daily Proctor Report (DPR) , reports and informing the students.

# Objectives
 1. This project will automate the manual system used for management and maintenance of the critical information.
 
 2. It will reduce the numerous paper forms.
 
 3. As the database is centralized, it reduces the redundancy and the inconsistencies in the data.
 
 4. It aims at standardizing data, consolidating data, ensuring data integrity by the use of data structures and searching information in O(1) time by hashing algorithms.
 
# Data structures used 
 1. Queue using linked lists.
 
 2. Hash table
